# Working with Vulnerable Populations

## Research & Learn

### Who are considered vulnerable populations, and what challenges might they face in digital spaces?

- **Vulnerable populations** may include neurodivergent individuals (e.g., those with ADHD, Autism), people with disabilities, mental health conditions, cognitive impairments, or those facing socioeconomic barriers.
- In digital environments, they may struggle with:
    - **Sensory overload** (e.g., flashing visuals, cluttered layouts)
    - **Cognitive overload** (e.g., too many steps, unclear instructions)
    - **Inaccessible design** (e.g., poor contrast, lack of keyboard navigation)
    - **Inflexible systems** that don’t adapt to different needs or learning styles

### What ethical considerations are important when designing or working with neurodivergent individuals?

- **Avoid overwhelming interfaces** – keep navigation simple and predictable
- **Respect sensory sensitivities** – avoid bright flashes, excessive animation, or loud default audio
- **Ensure communication is clear and supportive** – no assumptions or sarcasm
- **Involve neurodivergent users in feedback/testing** – respect lived experiences

### How can you make interactions and content more accessible for people with ADHD or Autism?

- Use **simple, direct language**
- Avoid long blocks of text – use **headings, bullet points, spacing**
- Break tasks into **smaller, actionable steps**
- Provide **visual cues** or progress indicators
- Minimize distractions in the UI
- Let users **customize settings** (e.g., reminders, font size, color mode)

### How can we support neurodivergent team members in a professional setting?

- Communicate **clearly and explicitly** (e.g., say what you mean, avoid vague feedback)
- Allow **flexible work hours or environments** (e.g., async communication)
- Respect different **working and thinking styles** – some people need quiet focus, others prefer collaboration
- Check in regularly, but don’t micromanage
- Use tools that support **task tracking and prioritization**
- Be open to feedback and willing to **adapt processes** for accessibility

## Reflection

### How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive?

- Use **concrete, specific language** instead of abstract instructions
- Be **direct but kind** – avoid passive-aggressive or overly subtle tones
- Use **bullet points, emojis, or labels** to make communication easier to scan
- Be mindful of **response expectations** – don’t pressure immediate replies

### What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible?

- Overwhelming dashboards or too many features on one screen
- Small or hidden buttons (e.g., low-contrast toggle switches)
- Instructions that assume prior knowledge or are too vague
- Notifications or timers that are abrupt or disruptive
- Inflexible routines with no option to adjust pacing or structure

### What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?

I will focus on using **plain, direct language** in all written communication and UI elements, and actively look for ways to **simplify user flows** to reduce cognitive load. 

## Task

### First-person account Videos:

In the video “[I’m a Doctor with ADHD: How I Really Focus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Ffhl6_OVM)” Dr Zeliha Akpinar walks viewers through the specific strategies she relies on to manage her attention and productivity. She credits her success at medical school and now clinical practice to a handful of repeatable habits: working during her personal “golden time” (3–8 a.m.), scheduling deliberate periods of boredom to reset overstimulated attention circuits, “phone-fasting” by physically removing her phone from view, and refusing to multitask to avoid the cognitive cost of task-switching. Each tactic is framed as a way to lower activation energy and build momentum for deep work. 

### Design/Communication Improvement for Focus Bear:

Focus Bear could incorporate (or highlight more prominently) an optional “**Phone-Fast**” mode that combines two features Dr Akpinar finds indispensable. When enabled, the mode would (1) trigger a short, full-screen “*hide your phone now*” prompt before each focus session and (2) lock notifications on desktop and mobile until the session ends. 

Pairing the visual cue with automatic notification suppression mirrors her strategy of placing the phone out of sight and eliminating dopamine-spiking pop-ups, lowering the temptation barrier for users with ADHD. Clear, encouraging message like “Your future self will thank you for putting the phone away!”, this would reinforce the behavior without judgment. 

### Supportive response to a user struggling with executive functioning:

Hey, I totally understand how overwhelming things can get, especially when your brain just won’t cooperate the way you want it to. You’re not alone in this, and it’s okay to take things one small step at a time. If you’re feeling stuck, try starting with just one simple task, even something like “open the app” or “write one sentence.” Progress doesn’t have to be perfect. Be kind to yourself, we’re here to support you, not pressure you.
