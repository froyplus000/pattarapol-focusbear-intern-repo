# Use of AI Tools

## Research & Learn

### What AI tools are typically used for your role?

- **ChatGPT / GPT-based tools** – for brainstorming, writing assistance, debugging help, and generating documentation.
- **GitHub Copilot & Claude Code** – for code suggestions and autocompletion in development.

### What are the benefits and risks of using AI in a professional setting?

**Benefits:**

- Speeds up repetitive tasks (e.g., writing, summarizing, code generation)
- Provides inspiration or starting points when facing creative or technical blocks
- Helps with language clarity and tone
- Can reduce time spent on research and formatting

**Risks:**

- AI-generated content can be **inaccurate or outdated**
- May introduce **biased or inappropriate suggestions**
- Risk of **data exposure** if sensitive information is input into public tools
- Can lead to **over-reliance**, reducing skill development and critical thinking

### What types of information should _never_ be entered into AI tools?

- Personal data (e.g., names, emails, phone numbers)
- Sensitive business data (e.g., internal plans, financial info, code IP)
- Client or user information (e.g., login credentials, private messages)

### How can you fact-check and validate AI-generated content to ensure accuracy?

- Cross-check information with **trusted sources** (official docs, company policies, academic references)
- Ask a supervisor or teammate to review content before using it professionally
- Compare AI suggestions with your own understanding or experience
- Use AI as a **starting point**, not a final product and always **review critically**

## Reflection

### When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?

- Use AI for:
  - Drafting, brainstorming, formatting, or generating boilerplate code
  - Explaining technical concepts in simpler terms
- Rely on your own skills for:
  - Decision-making
  - Reviewing and validating code or writing
  - Anything involving creative judgment, critical thinking, or ethical considerations

### How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?

- Treat AI as a **support tool**, not a replacement for your knowledge or problem-solving.
- Always **review, edit, and question** AI suggestions before accepting them.
- Use AI to **enhance learning**, try to understand what the AI is doing or suggesting.

### What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?

- **Never enter personal, private, or sensitive project data** into AI tools.
- Use **company-approved AI tools** (like Focus Bear-integrated ones) where possible.
- Review AI tool privacy policies before using them for any work-related task.
- Use AI tools offline or in secure environments when handling internal material.

## Task

### Identify one task you can improve using an AI tool, and try it out.

- **Task**: Writing a weekly project update summary

- **Tool used**: ChatGPT

- **Improvement**: AI helped organize bullet points into a more polished, professional summary faster.

### Review the AI-generated output critically — did it require editing or fact-checking?

Yes. I had to adjust some terminology to match the project's context and clarify parts where the AI was too generic. I also verified that the tone and content were aligned with our communication style.

### Document one best practice you will follow when using AI tools at Focus Bear.

I will **always review and edit AI-generated content before sharing it**, and avoid including any user, teammate, or internal project data in prompts.
