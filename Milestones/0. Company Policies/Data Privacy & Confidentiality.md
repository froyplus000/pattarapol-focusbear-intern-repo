- Inform Affected Users: Notify users whose data may have been compromised, explaining the nature of the breach and steps they should take.
- Document the Incident: Keep detailed records of the breach, actions taken, and communications.
- Review and Improve: After resolving the incident, review what happened and update security measures and policies to prevent future breaches.

## Reflection

### What steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?

- Only collect or access personal data **when absolutely necessary** for your role.
- Use **secure systems** (e.g., internal tools, approved storage platforms) instead of personal drives or public tools.
- **Keep software updated** to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities.
- **Lock your screen** when stepping away from your device.
- Use **strong, unique passwords** and enable **two-factor authentication (2FA)** when possible.

### How should you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?

- **Store** personal and sensitive data only on **approved, secure platforms** (e.g., encrypted databases, company cloud systems).
- **Share** data via secure channels, never through public links, unprotected documents, or personal messaging apps.
- **Dispose** of data by permanently deleting it from secure systems when it’s no longer needed and ensuring backups are also cleared, where applicable.
- Avoid downloading or exporting data unless absolutely required, and **never store it locally** unless explicitly approved.

### What are some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided?

| **Mistake**                              | **How to Avoid It**                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Using weak or reused passwords           | Use password managers and enable 2FA                                 |
| Sharing sensitive info over public tools | Use company-approved secure tools (e.g., encrypted storage or email) |
| Leaving devices unattended/unlocked      | Lock screens and use auto-lock settings                              |
| Downloading personal data unnecessarily  | Work directly within cloud tools where possible                      |
| Not reviewing access permissions         | Regularly audit who has access to sensitive data                     |

## Task

### One Habit or Practice to Improve Data Security

I will **avoid storing any personal or sensitive user data on local files** and only use **approved, secure systems** like Focus Bear’s cloud services and internal tools for all data handling.

### One Key Learning or Security Measure I Will Implement

I’ve learned the importance of **data minimization :** only collecting and retaining data that’s absolutely necessary. I’ll be mindful of this by **not requesting or saving unnecessary user data**, and by **deleting test or temp files** that contain personal information once they’re no longer needed.
