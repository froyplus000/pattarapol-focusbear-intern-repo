# Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) for Desk-Based Work

---

## 🎯 Goal

Understand how to **set up a safe and ergonomic workspace**, especially when using a laptop, and develop habits to prevent strain and discomfort.

## ❓ Why is this important?

Many people work directly on their laptops without an external monitor or keyboard, leading to **poor posture, neck strain, and wrist discomfort**. Making simple adjustments can **prevent long-term injuries and improve focus**.

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### What are the **risks of using a laptop without an external monitor or keyboard**?

- **Poor posture**: Hunched shoulders, forward head posture, and rounded back due to screen being too low.
- **Neck and back strain**: Looking down at a laptop screen causes neck and back pain.
- **Wrist strain**: Built-in laptop keyboards often force wrists into un-natural positions.
- **Eye strain**: Screen is often too close or too low, increasing fatigue.
- **Repetitive strain injuries (RSI)**: From prolonged typing on cramped keyboards or poor wrist angles.

### What **ergonomic equipment** can improve posture when working on a laptop? _(e.g., laptop stands, external keyboards, ergonomic chairs)_

| **Equipment**                 | **How It Helps**                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Laptop stand**              | Raises screen to eye level to reduce neck strain              |
| **External keyboard & mouse** | Keeps wrists in neutral position; promotes better arm posture |
| **Ergonomic chair**           | Supports natural spinal alignment with lumbar support         |
| **Adjustable desk**           | Allows standing/sitting variations                            |
| **Footrest**                  | Supports legs, especially if feet don't rest flat on floor    |

### What **adjustments** should be made to monitor height, chair position, and desk setup for a healthier workspace?

- **Monitor Height**: Top of screen at or slightly below eye level
- **Screen Distance**: Arm’s length away
- **Chair Position**:
  - Feet flat on floor or footrest
  - Knees at 90–100° angle
  - Lower back supported
- **Desk Setup**:
  - Elbows at 90° angle when typing
  - Wrists in neutral (not bent up/down)
  - Desk height: usually ~70–75cm for most people

### What are some **daily habits** that reduce the impact of prolonged laptop use? _(e.g., movement breaks, posture checks, eye strain reduction techniques)_

- **20-20-20 Rule**: Every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds to reduce eye strain.
- **Movement breaks**: Get up, stretch, or walk for 1–2 mins every 30–60 mins.
- **Posture checks**: Set reminders to sit upright and relax shoulders.
- **Desk stretching**: Simple shoulder rolls, neck tilts, wrist stretches.

## 📝 Reflection

### What **equipment changes** can you make to improve your workspace setup? _(e.g., using an external monitor, adjusting your chair, using a laptop stand)_

- Use a **laptop stand** to raise screen height
- Add an **external keyboard and mouse** for proper hand alignment
- Use **external monitor**
- Add a **footrest** if feet don’t touch the ground comfortably

### What **behavioral changes** can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain? _(e.g., sitting upright, taking regular breaks, adjusting screen height)_

- Sit upright with back supported and elbows at 90°
- Take a **1–2 min break every 30–45 minutes**
- Use **Focus Bear** or phone reminders to stretch or walk
- Follow **20-20-20** to rest my eyes

### How can you remind yourself to **maintain good posture and take breaks** throughout the day? _(Hint: Use Focus Bear to schedule movement breaks!)_

- Set Focus Bear to prompt:
  - “Sit tall” every 20 minutes
  - “Stand and stretch” every 45 minutes
- Use phone timer
