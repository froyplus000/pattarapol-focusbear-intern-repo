# Cyber Security

## Research & Learn

### What are common cyber security threats in a remote work environment?

- **Phishing attacks** (e.g., fake emails or links designed to steal credentials)
- **Weak or reused passwords** across multiple accounts
- **Unsecured Wi-Fi networks** at home or public places
- **Lost or stolen devices** without encryption or lock screens
- **Outdated software** with known vulnerabilities
- **Accidental data leaks** through screen sharing or cloud syncs

### What are best practices for keeping your devices and accounts secure?

- Use **strong, unique passwords** for each account
- Enable **two-factor authentication (2FA)** wherever possible
- Keep all software and devices **updated** regularly
- Use **password managers** to store credentials securely
- **Lock your screen** when stepping away, even for a few minutes
- Avoid clicking unknown links or downloading files from untrusted sources

### Why is it important to lock your computer when away from your desk?

- Prevents **unauthorized access** to sensitive company or user data
- Even a few unattended minutes could result in data theft or accidental changes
- It’s a simple but powerful way to **protect privacy and maintain professionalism**, especially in shared or public spaces

### How should you handle phishing attempts and suspicious links?

- **Do not click** any suspicious links or download unexpected attachments
- Double-check the sender's email address and look for signs of manipulation
- **Report** the email to your supervisor or IT/security contact immediately
- Delete the message after reporting
- When in doubt, verify the message **through another channel** (e.g., ask the person directly via Discord or Teams)

### What makes a strong password, and why should you use a password manager?

- A strong password is:
    - At least **12 characters long**
    - Includes **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**
    - Is **not based on common words, names, or patterns**
- Password managers:
    - Generate and store strong, unique passwords for each account
    - Eliminate the need to remember multiple complex passwords
    - Reduce the risk of password reuse and breaches

### Why is two-factor authentication (2FA) important, and when should you enable it?

- 2FA adds an **extra layer of protection** by requiring a second form of verification (e.g., phone code, authentication app)
- Even if someone gets your password, they won’t be able to log in without the second factor
- You should enable 2FA:
    - On **all work-related accounts**
    - On personal accounts that store sensitive data (e.g., email, bank, cloud storage)

## Reflection

### What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?

- **Currently following**:
    - Use of strong, unique passwords
    - Locking screen when away
    - Regular software updates
- **Need to improve**:
    - Using a dedicated password manager consistently
    - Double-checking email links and senders before opening

### How can you make secure behavior a habit rather than an afterthought?

- Set up **auto-lock timers** on all devices
- Use browser extensions or password managers to auto-fill securely
- Schedule a **monthly security check-up** (update passwords, review logins, etc.)
- Treat every app and message with a bit of healthy skepticism

### What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?

- Review all current passwords and update any weak or reused ones
- Set up **2FA** on all key platforms
- Start using a trusted **password manager** to store credentials
- Avoid saving passwords in plain text or unsecured notes

### What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?

- Immediately **change my password**
- **Log out of all active sessions** if possible
- Enable or review 2FA settings
- **Report the incident** to the Focus Bear team or security contact
- Avoid using the device until it's been scanned or reviewed

## Task

### Security Tasks Completed:

- ✅ Ensured all work accounts have **strong, unique passwords**
- ✅ Enabled **2FA** where available
- ✅ Set devices (laptop and phone) to **auto-lock after inactivity**
- ✅ Installed and configured a **password manager**

### One new cyber security habit I will follow at Focus Bear:

I will **always verify suspicious links or emails** before clicking and make it a habit to report anything that feels off, even if I’m unsure better safe than sorry.
