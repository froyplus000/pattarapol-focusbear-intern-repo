# Chrome Extensions Setup on Dia Browser

## Extensions Installed

1. **React Developer Tools**

   - Allows inspection of React components, props, and state in the browser’s DevTools.
   - Useful for debugging UI and understanding component structures.

2. **Redux DevTools**

   - Helps debug Redux state changes, actions, and the data flow.
   - Makes it easier to trace and replay application state during development.

3. **JSON Viewer Pro**

   - Formats and pretty-prints JSON data in the browser.
   - Useful for working with API responses to make them more readable.

4. **Lighthouse**
   - Provides performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practice audits for web apps.
   - Helps identify performance bottlenecks and opportunities to improve user experience.

## Most Useful Learning

The most useful thing I learned was how powerful **Lighthouse** is for analyzing and improving a web application’s performance. It not only highlights issues but also gives actionable recommendations for optimization, which can make a real impact on the quality of the app.

## Update: What and Why I Installed Each Extension

1. **React Developer Tools**

   I installed this extension because I occasionally work on personal projects that involve ReactJS development. As someone who's still learning React, having the ability to inspect component hierarchies, examine props and state changes in real-time, and understand how data flows through my applications is invaluable. This tool will help me debug React applications more efficiently and gain deeper insights into how React works under the hood. It's particularly useful when trying to understand why components aren't rendering as expected or when tracking down performance issues in React applications.

2. **Redux DevTools**

   While I haven't used Redux or state management libraries before, I know they're essential skills I'll need to learn as I advance in frontend development. State management becomes crucial in larger applications where multiple components need to share and update data. Installing this extension now prepares me for future development work on personal, university, or professional projects where state management is crucial. The ability to time-travel through state changes and see exactly how actions affect the application state will be incredibly helpful when I start building more complex applications that require centralized state management.

3. **JSON Viewer Pro**

   Since I'm currently focusing on backend development and API creation, I frequently work with JSON data formats when testing endpoints and examining API responses. This extension will likely be the most useful one on the list during my current learning phase, as it makes API responses and JSON data much more readable and easier to analyze during backend development. Instead of looking at minified JSON strings, I can now see properly formatted, syntax-highlighted JSON that's much easier to parse visually. This is especially helpful when working with complex nested objects or arrays in API responses, making debugging and development much more efficient.

4. **Lighthouse**

   Although I haven't used this extension before, I recognize the importance of regularly testing website performance, accessibility, and SEO in modern web development. Web performance directly impacts user experience and business metrics, so learning to use Lighthouse effectively is a valuable skill. I installed it to learn how to use it effectively for optimizing my projects and ensuring they meet web standards and accessibility guidelines. As I develop more web applications, I want to make sure they're not only functional but also performant, accessible to users with disabilities, and optimized for search engines. Lighthouse will help me identify bottlenecks and provide actionable recommendations for improvement.
