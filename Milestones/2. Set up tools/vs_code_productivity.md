## Reflection

### Which shortcuts will be most useful in daily work?

- **Select current word / select all same word** → speeds up refactoring and bulk changes.
- **Delete whole line / delete word** → removes mistakes instantly without mouse.
- **Open terminal** → essential since backend development often runs `npm`, `mvn`, `docker`, etc.

### How can keyboard shortcuts improve productivity?

- **Reduce context switching**: No need to leave keyboard for mouse navigation.
- **Faster refactoring**: Multi-cursor selection makes renaming and repetitive edits quick.
- **Better focus**: Opening files, running terminal commands, and debugging without breaking flow.
- Over time, using shortcuts becomes **muscle memory**, saving seconds per task → minutes per hour → hours per week.
