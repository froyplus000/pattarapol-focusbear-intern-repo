# Which AI tools did you try?

- ChatGPT
- GitHub Copilot

# What worked well? What didn’t?

- **ChatGPT** : worked well for researching, idea generation, asking general question and ask it to explain some fundamental concept with some basic analogy to help me better get understanding about thing that I'm learning at the time. It's not good at working with generating code in a complicated project, since it doesn't have ability to access every file in the project and have token limitation. These is why I think it should be use for discussing about ideas, researching and ask for explanation of specific question that I have rather than code generation.
- **GitHub Copilot** : I haven't been using this as much as ChatGPT but I think Copilot is very good for asking what is the error occured during development since it have access to the codebase. It would do well on finding out more about errors and suggest way to fix it. It not good at project discussion and researching.

# When do you think AI is most useful for coding?

AI is most useful when I already have a clear idea of what I’m going to implement. It can speed up repetitive coding tasks, help with debugging, and provide quick suggestions. However, for planning, architectural decisions, or deep problem-solving, AI is better used as a supportive tool rather than the main driver.
