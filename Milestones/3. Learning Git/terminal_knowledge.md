## Which terminal client did you choose? Why?

- **Client:** Warp (macOS)
- **Why I chose it:**
  - **Command Blocks**: groups each command with its output—easy to copy, share, and rerun.
  - **Fast & smooth**: native (Rust) rendering with low-latency UI.
  - **IDE-like UX**: search/history, autocomplete, command palette, tabs/panes.
  - **Workflows**: save parameterized commands and run them with prompts.
  - **Built-in themes** and a clean modern UI that reduces friction.

## What customizations (if any) did you make?

- **Change Theme:** _Fancy_ _Dracula_

## Most useful command learned today

- Show what’s listening on a port : `lsof -i :3000`
