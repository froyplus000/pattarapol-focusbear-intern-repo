# NestJS Dependency Injection Reflection (DI)

### How does dependency injection improve maintainability?

- DI reduces tight coupling by letting classes depend on abstractions instead of concrete implementations.
- Changes in one service don't require changes in every controller using it.
- Makes testing easier since real services can be swapped with mock providers.
- Overall, DI ensures a modular, flexible, and maintainable codebase.

---

### What is the purpose of the @Injectable() decorator?

- `@Injectable()` marks a class as a provider that can be managed by NestJS's IoC container.
- It allows the class to be injected into controllers or other services.
- Without `@Injectable()`, NestJS would not know how to create or provide the class.

---

### What are the different types of provider scopes, and when would you use each?

- **SINGLETON (default):** One shared instance for the whole app. Best for common services like authentication, data access, or logging.
- **REQUEST:** Creates a new instance per request. Useful when services must maintain request-specific state.
- **TRANSIENT:** Creates a new instance each time it's injected. Best for lightweight, stateless, or utility-style services.

---

### How does NestJS automatically resolve dependencies?

- When a class (e.g., controller) declares dependencies in its constructor, NestJS looks at the module's `providers` array.
- It creates an instance of each provider using the IoC container.
- It injects those instances into the requesting class automatically.
- This process is recursive, so services that depend on other services are resolved in the same way.

### Practical Examples of How DI Improves Maintainability

From my understanding, dependency injection makes code much easier to maintain because I can swap implementations without changing the code that uses them. For example:

```typescript
// Without DI - tightly coupled (bad)
export class UserController {
  private userService = new UserService(); // Hard dependency!

  getUser(id: string) {
    return this.userService.findById(id);
  }
}

// With DI - loosely coupled (good)
@Controller("users")
export class UserController {
  constructor(private readonly userService: UserService) {} // Injected!

  @Get(":id")
  getUser(@Param("id") id: string) {
    return this.userService.findById(id);
  }
}
```

**Why this matters in practice:**

- If I need to switch from a database service to an API service, I only change the provider registration in the module
- For testing, I can easily mock the UserService without touching the controller code
- Multiple controllers can share the same service instance (memory efficient)

### Real Understanding of @Injectable() Decorator

The `@Injectable()` decorator is like telling NestJS "Hey, this class is available for injection!" It's essentially registering the class with NestJS's IoC container so it can:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class EmailService {
  sendEmail(to: string, subject: string) {
    // Email logic here
  }
}

// This service can now be injected anywhere:
@Controller("notifications")
export class NotificationController {
  constructor(private emailService: EmailService) {} // NestJS knows how to provide this!
}
```

**What I learned:** Without `@Injectable()`, NestJS throws an error because it doesn't know how to create or manage the class lifecycle.

### Provider Scopes with Real-World Examples

Based on my understanding, here's when I'd use each scope:

**SINGLETON (Default):**

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class DatabaseService {
  // One connection pool shared across the entire app
  // Perfect for database connections, configuration, logging
}
```

**REQUEST:**

```typescript
@Injectable({ scope: Scope.REQUEST })
export class RequestContextService {
  private userId: string;

  setUserId(id: string) {
    this.userId = id;
  }
  getUserId() {
    return this.userId;
  }
}
// New instance per HTTP request - great for storing request-specific data
```

**TRANSIENT:**

```typescript
@Injectable({ scope: Scope.TRANSIENT })
export class UtilityService {
  generateId() {
    return Math.random().toString();
  }
}
// New instance every time it's injected - useful for stateless utilities
```

### How Automatic Dependency Resolution Actually Works

From what I understand, NestJS uses TypeScript's metadata to automatically resolve dependencies:

1. **Constructor Analysis:** NestJS reads the constructor parameters using reflection
2. **Provider Lookup:** It matches parameter types to registered providers in the module
3. **Recursive Resolution:** If a service depends on other services, NestJS resolves those first
4. **Instance Creation:** Finally creates and injects the instances

```typescript
// Example of the resolution process:
@Injectable()
export class UserService {
  constructor(private dbService: DatabaseService) {} // NestJS sees this dependency
}

@Controller("users")
export class UserController {
  constructor(private userService: UserService) {} // NestJS sees this dependency too
}

// In the module:
@Module({
  providers: [UserService, DatabaseService], // NestJS knows about these
  controllers: [UserController],
})
export class UserModule {}

// Resolution order:
// 1. Create DatabaseService (no dependencies)
// 2. Create UserService (inject DatabaseService)
// 3. Create UserController (inject UserService)
```

This reflection-based approach is what makes NestJS so powerful - I don't have to manually wire dependencies!
