# Understand competitive landscape

## Key Questions & Reflections

### What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?

- **Holistic neurodivergent support:** Focus Bear blends distraction blocking with habit coaching rooted in ADHD/ASD needs where most other apps focus on just one area.
- **Full-device integration:** Blocks distractions across desktop and mobile simultaneously, plus routine guidance not just a blocker or scheduler.
- **Science- and user-experience-driven:** Built by and for neurodivergent users, with input from ADHD specialists

### As a user, why choose Focus Bear over competitors?

- You want both **structure and focus,** not just blocking distractions or habit reminders, but a guided routine framework.
- You value **neuroinclusive design** that acknowledges executive dysfunction and tailors features accordingly.
- You prefer an app that uses **behavioral science and AI** to enhance adherence and habit strength.

### One feature other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t

- **Freedom’s finely-tuned scheduling and “Locked Mode”** may offer more robust blocklist customization and advanced scheduling control
- **Cold Turkey’s extreme lock-down options** (e.g., no bypassing) are stronger than Focus Bear’s, which may allow emergency overrides.
- **Tiimo’s highly visual drag-and-drop planner**, complete with shared profiles and neurodiversity-focused community tools is more comprehensive in calendar/task management

### One improvement Focus Bear could make

- **Improvement: Visual & Customizable Calendar View**
   - Add a Tiimo-style calendar with drag-and-drop scheduling, color-coded tasks, and icons to make planning more intuitive.
   - Overlay routines, offer multiple time views, and include progress indicators to help neurodivergent users visualize their day and stay motivated.
