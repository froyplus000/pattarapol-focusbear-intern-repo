# Agile Ceremonies & Team Collaboration

## **Research & Learn**

### **Main Agile Ceremonies and Their Purpose**

- **Daily Stand-ups**
   - **Purpose:** Short, focused meeting (usually 15 minutes) to share what was done yesterday, what will be done today, and any blockers.
   - **Benefit:** Keeps the team aligned and surfaces issues early.
- **Sprint Planning (Scrum)** vs **Continuous Prioritization (Kanban)**
   - **Sprint Planning (Scrum):**
      - Held at the start of each sprint to define what work will be done.
      - Sets a clear scope for the sprint.
   - **Continuous Prioritization (Kanban):**
      - No fixed sprints — priorities are reviewed regularly, and the most important tasks are pulled into “Ready” as capacity allows.
      - Flexible for changing priorities.
- **Retrospectives**
   - **Purpose:** Team reflects on the last sprint or work period to discuss what went well, what could improve, and action steps for the next cycle.
   - **Benefit:** Continuous improvement.
- **Backlog Refinement**
   - **Purpose:** Review and update the backlog by clarifying requirements, splitting large tasks, and prioritizing work.
   - **Benefit:** Ensures upcoming work is well-defined and ready to start.

### **How Agile Teams Collaborate Asynchronously and Across Time Zones**

- **Shared Tools:** Kanban boards (e.g., GitHub Projects, Jira), shared docs (Google Docs, Confluence).
- **Async Updates:** Using chat tools (Slack, Teams) and recorded video updates for progress sharing.
- **Clear Documentation:** Writing detailed task descriptions, acceptance criteria, and meeting notes so others can catch up without live meetings.
- **Overlap Hours:** Scheduling key discussions during overlapping working hours when possible.
- **Version Control Practices:** Using Git branching, pull requests, and code reviews so collaboration doesn’t depend on being online at the same time.

## **Reflection**

### **How Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment**

- They create regular, structured opportunities to share progress, surface problems, and confirm priorities.
- Everyone knows what others are working on and how their own tasks fit into the bigger goal.
- Ceremonies reduce miscommunication and keep the team moving in the same direction.

### **Which ceremony is most important for your role, and why?**

- **Daily Stand-ups** — because they give me immediate awareness of what others are doing, help me raise blockers quickly, and allow me to adapt my priorities based on team needs.

## **Task**

### **Attend a stand-up meeting and observe how updates are shared**

- Team members give **brief updates** (Yesterday → Today → Blockers).
- Focus is on progress and removing roadblocks, not deep problem-solving.
- Update team with my progress on Onboarding Milestone tasks.

### **Review past notes**

- Retrospectives focus on **three key questions**:
   1. What went well?
      - Backend environment setting for **all member**
      - Clean Code and finish the rest  of on-boarding issues for **Pratik**
   2. What didn’t go well? (To Improve)
      - Underestimated work load for issue 210. Should get **Pratik** involved and helped early.
      - Be more ready to showcase work progress during next planning and retro.
   3. What can we improve for next time? (Action)
      - Keep looking for backlog to refine based on priority. Then compile them in a list to be reviewed by other members from **Freddy.**

### **Document one change you can make to improve your team collaboration**

   **Change:** Write more detailed Git commit messages and pull request descriptions so team members in other time zones can understand changes without waiting for me to explain live.
