# Agile Workflows & Kanban

## **Research & Learn**

### **How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?**

- **How it works:**

   A Kanban board is a visual project management tool that organizes work into columns representing different stages of a process. Each task is shown as a card that moves through the stages from left to right.

- **How it helps:**
   - Makes work progress visible to the whole team.
   - Helps identify bottlenecks (e.g., too many items stuck “In Progress”).
   - Supports continuous delivery by allowing work to flow smoothly without overloading team members.

### **2. What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent?**

Using your screenshot as an example:

- **Backlog:**

   Tasks that have been identified but not started yet (e.g., “Testing Redux with Jest”).

- **Ready:**

   Tasks that are prepared and ready for someone to pick up next.

- **In Progress:**

   Tasks actively being worked on (e.g., “Agile Workflows & Kanban”).

- **In Review:**

   Tasks that have been completed but need review or approval before being marked as done.

- **Done:**

   Tasks that are completed and require no further work (e.g., “Cyber Security”).

### **3. How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?**

- **Movement:**

   Tasks move **left to right** through the workflow as work is started, progressed, reviewed, and completed.

- **Responsibility:**

   Usually, the person working on the task is responsible for moving it to the next column. In some teams, a project manager or scrum master also helps monitor and update statuses.

### **4. What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?**

- Prevents **overload** by ensuring team members focus on fewer tasks at a time.
- Improves **quality** because attention isn’t split across too many things.
- Speeds up **delivery** by completing tasks faster rather than having many half-finished items.
- Makes **bottlenecks visible** so the team can address them quickly.

## **Reflection**

### **How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?**

- By making all tasks visible, Kanban allows the team to focus on what’s most important first.
- WIP limits ensure that no one takes on too much work at once.
- The “Ready” column acts as a buffer so people pick up the right next task instead of randomly choosing from the backlog.

### **How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?**

- Regularly review and refine the “Backlog” to ensure it only contains relevant tasks.
- Use clear criteria for moving tasks from one column to the next (e.g., definition of “done” for “In Progress” → “In Review”).
- Apply WIP limits for “In Progress” to keep focus on finishing work rather than starting new work.
- Have quick daily check-ins to see where tasks are stuck.

### **Check out Focus Bear’s Kanban board and note how tasks are structured**

- Tasks are structured as **cards** with a title and sometimes an issue number (e.g., `pattarapol-focusbear-intern-repo #48`).
- They are grouped by workflow stages: Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → Done.

### **Move at least one task through the Kanban process and update its status correctly**

Example process:

If start working on “Set up a terminal client”:

1. Move from **Backlog** → **In Progress**.
2. Once complete, move to **In Review**.
3. After approval, move to **Done**.

### **Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role**

- Add **labels or tags** (e.g., “frontend,” “backend,” “testing”) to quickly filter tasks by type.
- Include **due dates** on tasks so priorities are easier to spot.
- Write **clear, actionable task descriptions** to avoid confusion.
