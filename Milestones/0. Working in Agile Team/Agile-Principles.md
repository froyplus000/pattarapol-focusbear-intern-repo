# Working in an Agile Team

## Research & Learn

### What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?

- **Agile** is an iterative, flexible approach to project management focused on delivering value in small, frequent increments.
- **Traditional project management** (e.g., Waterfall) follows a linear, sequential process with a fixed plan from start to finish.
- **Key differences**:
  - Agile adapts to change quickly, while traditional methods often resist changes once the plan is set.
  - Agile delivers working outputs early and often, while traditional methods deliver the final product at the end.
  - Agile involves ongoing collaboration, while traditional methods often separate planning and execution phases.

### What are the core values and principles of Agile?

**Four Core Values:**

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

**Some Key Principles:**

- Deliver value to the customer early and continuously
- Welcome changing requirements
- Work closely with stakeholders
- Build projects around motivated individuals
- Regularly reflect and adapt processes

### What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?

- **Scrum**:
  - Works in fixed-length sprints (e.g., 2 weeks)
  - Roles are clearly defined (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team)
  - Uses ceremonies like daily stand-ups, sprint planning, sprint reviews
  - Best for teams delivering features in predictable cycles
- **Kanban**:
  - Continuous flow of work — no fixed-length sprints
  - Focuses on visualizing tasks on a board and limiting work in progress (WIP)
  - Flexible and adaptable — tasks are pulled as capacity allows
  - Best for teams with ongoing, incoming tasks that vary in size or priority

### Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?

- Focus Bear’s workflow often involves **continuous updates, bug fixes, and small improvements** rather than fixed-scope feature sprints.
- Kanban allows **more flexibility** in prioritizing and re-prioritizing tasks as new needs arise.
- The team can focus on **flow and responsiveness** instead of fitting work into rigid sprint cycles.

## Reflection

### Biggest benefits of Agile:

- Faster delivery of value
- Ability to adapt to changes quickly
- Encourages communication and collaboration
- Continuous improvement through feedback

### Biggest challenges of Agile:

- Requires high team discipline to avoid chaos
- Needs strong communication to be effective
- Can be harder to predict timelines and budgets

### How Agile principles can help in my role:

- Encourages me to **adapt quickly** to changing priorities
- Promotes **transparent communication** with teammates
- Helps me focus on delivering small, meaningful improvements rather than waiting for big releases

## Task

### Main differences between Scrum and Kanban (in my own words):

> Scrum is like working in short, fixed “game rounds” where the team commits to a set of tasks for that round, while Kanban is more flexible, tasks keep moving through the system, and you pick up the next one when you have capacity.

### One Agile principle most useful for my work:

> _“Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.”_ This principle helps me stay flexible and open to improving the product based on real feedback, rather than being locked into a plan that may no longer be the best option.

### My experiences on Scrum or Kanban

- I have very little experience with Scrum, I used it once in one of university group project in the past. Where we were introduced with Agile, tools like Confluence and Jira.
- I never use Kanban before but I think I saw similar User Interface on Trello.

### How would I use Agile to help manage my work in the future?

- I like Kanban board concept, I think it help me see clearer what task I have to do. I would use this in my future personal project where time constraint won't be an issue.
- I can see that many company uses Scrum for software development, so there is a great chance that I will be using Scrum for my job as a software developer.
