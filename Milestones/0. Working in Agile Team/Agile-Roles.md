# Roles in an Agile Team

## Research & Learn

### **Key Roles in an Agile Team**

| Role                                            | Main Responsibilities                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Developers                                      | Build and maintain the product’s features, fix bugs, write clean and maintainable code, and ensure functionality matches requirements.    |
| QA (Quality Assurance)                          | Test the product to find defects, verify that features meet acceptance criteria, and maintain quality through automated/manual testing.   |
| Product Manager (PM)                            | Defines the product vision, prioritizes features, manages the product roadmap, and ensures the product meets customer and business needs. |
| Agile Project Manager (Agile PM) / Scrum Master | Facilitates the Agile process, removes blockers, ensures the team follows Agile principles, and helps improve team productivity.          |

**Other Supporting Roles**

- **Stakeholders**: Provide business context, approve major decisions, and give feedback.
- **UX Designers**: Ensure the product is user-friendly and meets design guidelines.
- **Customer Support**: Share user feedback and issues to help guide improvements. |

### **Collaboration in Kanban vs. Scrum**

| Aspect           | Scrum                                                                                                                     | Kanban                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Workflow         | Time-boxed sprints with set goals. Roles collaborate heavily during sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and sprint reviews. | Continuous flow — work items are picked up as capacity allows. Collaboration is ongoing and less tied to fixed timeframes. |
| Meetings         | More structured: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective.                                       | Fewer formal meetings — collaboration often happens asynchronously or in ad-hoc sessions.                                  |
| Role Interaction | Roles plan together for each sprint, commit to work, and deliver incrementally.                                           | Roles coordinate based on work-in-progress (WIP) limits and current priorities.                                            |

## Reflection

### **My Role:**

As a Backend Developer Intern, I contribute to the Agile process by implementing and maintaining the server-side logic, APIs, and database interactions that power the application. I ensure that backend services are reliable, secure, and optimized for performance. I also work closely with other team members to integrate backend functionality with the frontend and external services.

### **How my responsibilities interact with others:**

- **QA:** I collaborate with QA to verify that API endpoints work as expected and meet acceptance criteria. I also fix any defects they discover during testing.
- **Frontend Developers:** I work with them to align on API specifications, data formats, and integration requirements.
- **Product Manager:** I clarify technical feasibility and provide time estimates for backend tasks.

## Task

### **Short description of how my role fits into the Agile team**

As a Backend Developer Intern, I design, implement, and maintain backend features and APIs that support the product’s core functionality. My work ensures that the system runs efficiently, securely, and can handle the required data and traffic. I support the Agile process by delivering backend capabilities in small, testable increments and collaborating closely with other roles to ensure smooth integration.

**One role I frequently collaborate with:** **QA**

- **Current teamwork:** I provide QA with clear API documentation, example requests/responses, and guidance on how to test backend features. I address bugs quickly and verify fixes through retesting.
- **How to improve teamwork:** Involve QA earlier during feature development by sharing API changes before implementation is complete, and actively participate in test case discussions to anticipate edge cases.
