# Creating REST APIs with NestJS - Reflection

## What is the role of a controller in NestJS?

In my demo project, the `UsersController` serves as the **HTTP request handler** and **routing layer**. Its primary responsibilities include:

- **Route Definition**: Using decorators like `@Get()`, `@Post()`, `@Put()`, and `@Delete()` to map HTTP methods to specific endpoints
- **Request/Response Handling**: Extracting data from request parameters (`@Param('id')`), request body (`@Body()`), and sending responses back to clients
- **Delegation**: Acting as a thin layer that delegates business logic to the service layer rather than handling it directly
- **Input Validation**: Working with DTOs (`CreateUserDto`, `UpdateUserDto`) to ensure proper data structure

The controller essentially acts as the **entry point** for HTTP requests in the `/users` route.

## How should business logic be separated from the controller?

In my implementation, I followed the **separation of concerns** principle:

**Controller Layer (`users.controller.ts`)**:
- Handles HTTP-specific concerns (routing, request/response)
- Validates input through DTOs
- Calls appropriate service methods
- Returns results to clients

**Service Layer (`users.service.ts`)**:
- Contains all business logic and data manipulation
- Handles database operations through TypeORM repository
- Implements error handling (e.g., `NotFoundException` when user not found)
- Manages entity relationships and data validation

This separation makes the code more **maintainable**, **testable**, and **reusable**.

## Why is it important to use services instead of handling logic inside controllers?

Using services provides several benefits demonstrated in my project:

1. **Single Responsibility**: Controllers focus solely on HTTP concerns while services handle business logic
2. **Reusability**: The `UsersService` can be injected into other parts of the application if needed
3. **Testability**: Business logic in services can be unit tested independently from HTTP layer
4. **Dependency Injection**: NestJS's DI system allows for easy mocking and testing
5. **Code Organization**: Clear separation makes the codebase easier to navigate and maintain

In my demo, the `UsersService` handles complex operations like user existence validation and database transactions, keeping the controller clean and focused.

## How does NestJS automatically map request methods (GET, POST, etc.) to handlers?

NestJS uses **decorators** and **reflection** to automatically map HTTP methods:

1. **Method Decorators**: 
   - `@Get()` maps to HTTP GET requests
   - `@Post()` maps to HTTP POST requests  
   - `@Put(':id')` maps to HTTP PUT requests with an ID parameter
   - `@Delete(':id')` maps to HTTP DELETE requests with an ID parameter

2. **Route Parameters**: 
   - `@Param('id')` automatically extracts route parameters
   - `@Body()` extracts and validates request body data

3. **Automatic Serialization**: 
   - Return values are automatically serialized to JSON
   - DTOs provide structure and validation for request/response data

4. **Path Combination**: 
   - `@Controller('users')` + `@Get(':id')` creates the route `GET /users/:id`

This **decorator-based approach** eliminates the need for manual route configuration and provides a clean, declarative way to define API endpoints.
